# Ensures that an entire partition contains exactly the files from
# a certain OS build and nothing else.
# https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/249 explains
# the steps used by this script.
#
# There are some prerequisites for this script:
# - the current locale must support UTF-8 encoding because
#   currently unpacking files relies on that
#   (https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/280)
# - there must be enough space on the target partition for
#   the entire OS plus a compressed archive of the OS
#   (https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/285)
# - the swupd update repo must be available via http(s),
#   and connectivity should be good; loss of network activity
#   will be detected
#
# The script returns with the following codes:
# 0 = success
# 1 = permanent failure, retrying probably won't help
# 2 = temporary network failure, can be tried again later
#
# "set -e" is not used intentionally, instead relying on explicit
# error checking.

-t pickytree    the sub-tree where --picky looks for extra files

Ensures that an entire partition contains exactly the files from a
certain OS build and nothing else. Incremental updates are tried when
the content URL is exactly the same as the one for the current
partition content.

# The swupd statedir only gets created once and then gets reused
# across different swupd invocations. The assumption is that swupd
# itself never corrupts its own state, thus allowing us to reuse
# already downloaded information. A more conservative approach would
# be to wipe out state before each invocation.
#
# The goal is to do this:
# STATEDIR=$(mktemp -d)
#
# In practice, the statedir currently has to be on the target
# partition, for two reason:
# - staging files happens under it and additional workarounds
#   would be needed to make rootfs construction work
#   without inefficient copying from the statedir to
#   the target partition (https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/273)
# - bsdtar fails to unpack Manifest.MoM.tar on tmpfs:
#   ioctl(4, FS_IOC_GETFLAGS, 0x7ffe5c46d874) = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
#   No bug filed at the moment.
#
# The downside is that currently the target partition must have
# enough extra space to store the pack .tar archives. See
