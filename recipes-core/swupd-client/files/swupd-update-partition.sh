# The swupd statedir only gets created once and then gets reused
# across different swupd invocations. The assumption is that swupd
# itself never corrupts its own state, thus allowing us to reuse
# already downloaded information. A more conservative approach would
# be to wipe out state before each invocation.
#
# The goal is to do this:
# STATEDIR=$(mktemp -d)
#
# In practice, the statedir currently has to be on the target
# partition, for two reason:
# - staging files happens under it and additional workarounds
#   would be needed to make rootfs construction work
#   without inefficient copying from the statedir to
#   the target partition (https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/273)
# - bsdtar fails to unpack Manifest.MoM.tar on tmpfs:
#   ioctl(4, FS_IOC_GETFLAGS, 0x7ffe5c46d874) = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
#   No bug filed at the moment.
#
# The downside is that currently the target partition must have
# enough extra space to store the pack .tar archives. See
# https://github.com/clearlinux/swupd-client/issues/285
